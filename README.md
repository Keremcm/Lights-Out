# Lights Out Game 🎮

Lights Out is a classic logic puzzle game implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library. The goal is to turn off all the yellow tiles (lights) on the board. Clicking a tile toggles its state and also toggles the state of adjacent tiles, making it a challenging and fun mathematical game.
